# 🏓 Single Bat Pong Game

This is a simple Pong-inspired game written in C++ using the SFML library. You control a single bat that rebounds a ball from the top of the window. The ball gets faster with time, your score increases with every rebound, and the game ends when you lose all 3 lives.

## 🎮 Game Features

- Single bat controlled by the player
- Ball rebounds from the bat and screen edges
- Score increases with each successful rebound
- 3 lives — lose one if the ball misses the bat
- Game ends when all lives are lost

## 🛠 Requirements

- C++ Compiler (e.g., g++)
- SFML Library (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)

Make sure SFML is installed and properly linked.

## 📦 Installation & Running

Use the provided `Makefile` to build and run the game:

### 🔨 Compile
```bash
make compile
```

### ▶️ Run
```bash
make run
```

### 🧹 Clean (remove build artifacts)

Alternatively, run everything in one step:
